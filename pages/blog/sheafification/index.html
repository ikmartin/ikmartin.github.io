I reviewed it recently to recover from summer rustiness and wanted to make the argument that it is, in fact, actually pretty straightforward.</p> <p>There are two additional axioms a presheaf \(\mathcal F\) on \(X\) must satisfy to be a sheaf:</p> <ol> <li><p>&#40;<em>Locality</em>&#41; &nbsp;Let \(U\) be covered by \(U_i\). If \(s,t \in \mathcal F(U)\) satisfy \(s|_{U_i} = t|_{U_i}\) for all \(i\), then \(s = t\).</p> <li><p>&#40;<em>Gluing</em>&#41; &nbsp;&nbsp; Again let \(U\) be covered by \(U_i\). If there exist sections \(s_i \in \mathcal F(U_i)\) such that \(s_i|_{U_i\cap U_j} = s_j|_{U_i \cap U_j}\) then there exists some \(s \in \math cal F(U)\) such that \(s|_{U_i} = s_i\).</p> </ol> <p>Thus, there are two ways a sheaf can fail to be a presheaf: it can violate locality by having <em>extra</em> sections which are equal locally but not globally or it can violate gluing by having <em>too few</em> sections to glue stuff together. Sheafification therefore consists of removing all sections which violate locality and adding extra sections to ensure gluing is possible. There&#39;s an excellent mathoverflow post this: <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/45212/how-should-one-think-about-sheafification-and-the-difference-between-a-sheaf-and">here&#39;s a link</a>. It also motivated this entry.</p> <div class=" gradient"><span class=fancytext > Examples</span></div> <p>Examples of presheaves which violate gluing are pretty natural; lots of properties are easy or even trivial to satisfy locally but are much harder to satisfy globally.</p> <div class=revindentparagraph ><span><strong> Example 1</strong>: <em> (Violating Gluing).</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Let \(X = \mathbb C\) and define \(\mathcal F(U)\) to be the collection of all polynomials bounded on \(U\). If we additionally define \(\mathcal F(\emptyset) = 0\) &#40;see the Appendix&#41; then \(\mathcal F\) is a presheaf. As long as \(U\) itself is bounded and nonempty, \(\mathcal F(U) = \mathbb C[z]\), but Louiville&#39;s theorem tells us that the only bounded holomorphic functions on all of \(\mathbb C\) are constant. In particular, if \(D_r\) is the open disk of radius \(r\) centered at \(0\), then \(f(z) = z\) is bounded on \(D_r\), but there is no section \(g \in \mathcal F(\mathbb C) = \mathbb C\) such that \(g|_{D_r}(z) = f(z)\). Sheafification applied to \(\mathcal F\) therefore adds in the extra functions; it just expands \(\mathcal F(U)\) so that it too is \(\mathbb C[z]\). The sheafification of \(\mathcal F\) is therefore the constant sheaf associated to \(\mathbb C[z]\).</div> <p><em>Takeaway: A function can be simultaneously be bounded locally and unbounded globally. Hence the &#39;bounded&#39; condition is removed.</em></p> <div class=revindentparagraph ><span><strong> Example 2</strong>: <em> (Violating Gluing).</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Let \(X = S^1\), and pick two distinct points \(p \neq q \in S^1\). For any \(U\subseteq S^1\) define \(\mathcal F(U)\) to be all continuous functions \(f:U\to \mathbb R\) such that \(f(p) = f(q)\). Whenever \(U\) includes \(p\) but not \(q\), this equality condition disappears and \(\mathcal F(U)\) is the set of <em>all</em> continuous functions on \(U\). Therefore if \(U\) is a neighborhood of \(p\) which avoids \(q\) and \(V\) a neighborhood of \(q\) which avoids \(p\), then two sections \(f\in \mathcal F(U)\) and \(g\in \mathcal F(V)\) only glue if they agree on \(U\cap V\) and if \(f(p) = g(q)\). Sheafification of \(\mathcal F\) adds in all these extra sections, and thus the sheafification of \(\mathcal F\) is the sheaf of continuous functions on \(S^1\).</div> <p><em>Takeaway: The property \(f(p) = f(q)\) is not a local property, hence it is removed.</em></p> <p>Examples of locality violation feel less natural to me because it&#39;s hard to construct them by imposing conditions on sets of functions. After all, if two functions are equal in every neighborhood of a space, then they&#39;re equal everywhere. It feels better to think about &quot;equivalence&quot;, in my opinion. I can easily imagine two things which are &quot;similar locally&quot; but are not similar globally. Here&#39;s an example utilizing the boundedness example from earlier.</p> <div class=revindentblock ><p><span><strong> Example 3</strong>: <em> (Violating Locality).</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Again let \(X = \mathbb C\), let \(\mathcal F\) be the sheaf of holomorphic functions and let \(\mathbb G\) be the presheaf of bounded holomorphic functions. Now define a presheaf \(\mathcal H(U) = \mathcal F(U)/\mathcal G(U)\). At any \(x\in X\) we get \(\mathcal H_x = 0\), since any holomorphic function defined at \(x\) is bounded in a suitably small neighborhood of \(x\). However, functions like \(f(z) = z\) are not in the class of zero in \(\mathcal H(X)\), since they are not bounded globally. Contrast these two sets:</p> <ul> <li><p>\(\mathcal H_x = \{0\}\) for reasons described above</p> <li><p>\(\mathcal H(X) = \{\text{entire functions}\}/\mathbb C\), since the only bounded functions on \(X\) are the constant functions.</p> </ul> <p>The set \(\mathcal H(U)\) is kind of like &quot;unbounded functions on \(U\) up to boundedness&quot;. Two functions \(f\) and \(g\) can both be bounded on a small set \(U\), but for a strictly larger set \(f\) might become unbounded while \(g\) remains bounded. The sheafification of \(\mathcal H\) throws away all sections for which local equivalence doesn&#39;t imply global equivalence. Since all holomorphic functions are equivalent to a bounded function on a sufficiently small set, this is just the constant zero sheaf.</p> <p><em>Takeaway: Locally bounded doesn&#39;t imply globally bounded for all sections, so all sections which are only locally bounded are thrown out.</em></p></div> <div class=" gradient"><span class=fancytext > The Image Sheaf</span></div> <h2></h2> <div class=page-foot > Â©Isaac Martin.
