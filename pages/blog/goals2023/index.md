# Goals for Spring (and maybe Summer) of 2023

\toc

---

The new year is upon us, and though I am not a fan of traditional resolutions, I do believe there is utility in writing down one's goals in an accessible place and returning frequently to analyze progress.

## Primary Goals

If I don't finish these things, I'll be quite sad by the time arrives. Here's the list:

- Complete at least 1/3 of the exercises in Chapters II and III of Hartshorne.
- Complete the preliminary exam and course requirements for the Ph.D.
- Work through most of Fulton's _Introduction to Toric Varieties_
- Understand the log geometry portion of "Decomposition of degenerate Gromov-Witten invariants"
- Choose an advisor

#### Complete at least 1/3 of the exercises in Chapters II and III of Hartshorne.

I've been working through Hartshorne sporadically over the past two years. It's time to wade through it earnestly. There are a total of **222 exercises** between chapters II and III of Hartshorne, so I'll need to complete **74 exercises** by May. That's about **2 exercises every 3 days**.

#### Complete the preliminary exam and course requirements for the Ph.D.

UT Austin's math Ph.D. program requires students to complete 7 preliminary courses in order to advance to the second stage of the Ph.D., and at least 3 of those courses by exam. I've finished one exam and two courses at the time of this writing. I think I'll receive credit for 3 courses I completed at Utah and will take two more exams in January. If everything goes perfectly then I will be done quite soon, but in the likely scenario in which I fail at least one of the exams, I will need to study and retake it in either June or August. If I am done with this stage of the Ph.D. by Fall 2023, I'll consider that a success.

#### Work through most of Fulton's _Introduction to Toric Varieties_

I'm going to help run the Beginner Algebraic Geometry Seminar (BAGS) during the Spring of 2023 (see the [seminar webpage](/pages/blog/toric-page)). Our primary goal is to work through the majority of Fulton's toric varieties textbook.

#### Understand the log geometry portion of "Decomposition of degenerate Gromov-Witten invariants"

I suspect log geometry will be the topic of my eventual thesis and would like to understand more about it by the end of 2023. The above paper is a bit of a beast, but understanding a piece of it seems reasonable and is a more actionable goal than "understand more log geometry".

#### Choose an advisor

This one is self explanatory.

## Secondary Goals

These would be nice things to do, but are either not vital for my advancement towards a Ph.D. or can be completed in the future.

- Complete publishable work on Ising computation
- Become more familiar with two of the following programming languages: Julia, Rust, Haskell, Go Lang.
- Find a preliminary research topic
- Complete a machine learning project
