Even worse, schemes are famously more difficult to digest than their classical counterparts. So, why was it that schemes were almost immediately adopted by the mathematical community when Grothendieck introduced them?</p> <p>This post was inspired by a two-page document of the same name written by <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~mckernan/Teaching/07-08/Spring/18.726/l_1.pdf">James McKernan</a>.</p> <h3 id=schemes_can_live_on_their_own ><a href="#schemes_can_live_on_their_own" class=header-anchor >Schemes can live on their own</a></h3> <p>A classical variety depends on an embedding into projective space.</p> <h3 id=group_actions_on_varieties_feel_suspicious ><a href="#group_actions_on_varieties_feel_suspicious" class=header-anchor >Group actions on varieties feel suspicious</a></h3> <h3></h3> <div class=page-foot > Â©Isaac Martin.
