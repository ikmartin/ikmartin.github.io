# Introduction to F-Singularities

I've given the same talk about *F*-singularities a couple times now, and while preparing for what will likely be the final presentation I do on this topic for a while, I thought it would be nice to write some of this stuff down.

### What is a singularity?

Consider the following two curves.

<Nodal curve/> <Cuspoidal Curve/>

Both of these curves is smooth everywhere except the origin, where they feature some strange behavior. The nodal curve has two tangent lines at the origin while the cuspoidal curve has infinitely many tangent lines passing through it at the origin; that is, differentiability fails at the origin in both of these curves.

This is the notion of differentiability that appears in complex analysis. For instance, a meromorphic function is a function which differntibal everywhere on the complex plane *except* at a discrete set of points, and we call those points singularities. However,
