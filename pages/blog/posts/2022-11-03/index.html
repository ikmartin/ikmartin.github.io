The nodal curve has two tangent lines at the origin while the cuspoidal curve has infinitely many tangent lines passing through it at the origin; that is, differentiability fails at the origin in both of these curves.</p> <p>This is the notion of differentiability that appears in complex analysis. For instance, a meromorphic function is a function which differntibal everywhere on the complex plane <em>except</em> at a discrete set of points, and we call those points singularities.
