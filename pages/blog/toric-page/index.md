# Toric Geometry Learning Seminar Spring 2023

\toc

---

## Proposed Plan

There are many directions we could take this, but I'd personally like to approach it as if the participants have never heard of a toric variety before. My idea is that we can follow Fulton and Cox/Little/Schenk's books, taking turns presenting on chapters/topics each week. We could also leave some time at the end for special topics not found in either of these books.

### Potential Topics

Here's a potential list of topics:

#### Tori and fans and first properties
- Definition of toric variety, cones and fans
- Smoothness
- Blowups
- Orbit Cone Correspondence

#### Divisors and Line Bundles
- Toric divisors
- Weil/Cartier Divisors
- Line bundles

#### Generalizations
- Log geometry?
- Spherical varieties?

### Resources
Here are some books/notes
- [*Introduction to Toric Varieties* by Fulton](documents/Introduction-to-Toric-Varieties_Fulton.pdf)
- [*Toric Varieties* by Cox, Little Schneck](documents/Toric-Varieties_Cox-Little-Schenck.pdf)
- [*Toric-Geometry*, course notes by Dhruv Ranganathan](documents/Toric-Geometry_Dhruv.pdf)
- [Toric Notes, handwritten and scanned by Navid Nabijou](documents/Navid-ToricNotes.pdf)
Here are some problem sheets assigned by Navid in his toric geometry course:
- [*Example Sheet 1*](documents/ToricSheet1.pdf)
- [*Example Sheet 2*](documents/ToricSheet2.pdf)
- [*Example Sheet 3*](documents/ToricSheet3.pdf)
- [*Example Sheet 4*](documents/ToricSheet4.pdf)
