# A first look at toric varieties

\toc

---

This primer was written with the Junior Geometry graduate seminar at UT Austin in mind. Some participants had not seen schemes before; so I started with a lightning fast introduction taking people from vanishing sets of polynomials to $\Spec$. The main point of this writeup is to demonstrate that you can do algebraic geometry using arbitrary rings, though we fail to explain the Zariski topology.

## An extraordinarily fast primer on algebraic geometry

Algebraic geometry studies, among other things, algebraic varieties. These are shapes cut out by polynomials. For instance, $X = V(x^2 + y^2 - 1)\subseteq K^2$ is an algebraic variety consisting of all points where the polynomial $x^2 + y^2 - 1$ vanishes. Here $K$ is the base field for my polynomial ring.

It also makes sense to consider the vanishing set of multiple polynomials at once, for instance $V(x^2 + y^2 - 1, x = 0)$ consists of the two points $(x,y) = (0, 1), (0,-1)$ since these are the only places where both polynomials simultaneously vanish. 

Notice also that for two polynomials $f$ and $g$, $f + g$ vanishes whenever both $f$ and $g$ vanish and $fg$ vanishes wherever at least one of $f$ or $g$ vanishes. This means that if $I = (f_1,...,f_m)$ is the ideal generated by $f_1,...,f_m$ then $V(I) = V(f_1,...,f_m)$. We therefore can talk only about the vanishing of polynomial ideals without losing any generality.

Invertible polynomials, i.e. nonzero constants, don't vanish anywhere while the 0 polynomial vanishes everywhere:
- $V(c) = \emptyset$ if $c \in K$
- $V(c) = K^n$ if $c = 0$, where $n$ is the number of indeterminants in my polynomial ring.

Sometimes non-invertible polynomials don't vanish anywhere either. For instance, if $K = \bQ$, then $x^2 - 2$ has no solutions. Similarly, if $K = \bR$, $x^2 + y^2 + 1$ has no solutions. This does *not* happen when $K = \overline{K}$, that is, when $K$ is algebraically closed.

When $K = \overline{K}$ there is another notably nice property: every point $(a_1,...,a_n) \in K^n$ is the unique point where $x_1 - a_1,x_2 - a_2, ..., x_n - a_n$ all simultaneously vanish. This gives us a correspondence between points in $K^n$ and *maximal ideals* of the form $(x_1 - a_1,...,x_n - a_n)$ by taking vanishing sets. In fact, when $K = \overline{K}$, one can show that all maximal ideals are of this form, and so if we denote the set of all maximal ideals in $R = K[x_1,...,x_n]$ by $\operatorname{Maxspec}$, then

$$K^n = \operatorname{Maxspec}(R).$$

One can more generally consider the space of all prime ideals $\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ endowed with the [Zariski toplogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zariski_topology). This contains $\operatorname{R}$ as a subset, but has additional "points" which prove useful whenever $K$ is not algebraically closed. In fact, $\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ makes sense for *any* ring $R$. By analogy with $K^n$ and $\operatorname{Maxspec}(K[x_1,...,x_n])$ for algebraically closed $K$, we denote by $\bA^n_R$ the space $\Spec(R[x_1,...,x_n])$ and call it *affine space over $R$*.

Replacing $K^n$ by $\Spec(K[x_1,...,x_n])$ allows us to use ring operations to manipulate the underlying affine space. As alluded to earlier, invertible elements of our ring $R$ will not vanish anywhere. Thus, if we want to ignore portions of the space $\Spec(R)$ we can adjoin the multiplicative inverses of certain elements to our ring. This process of inverting a designated subset of elements in a ring is aptly called *localization*.

For example, consider one-dimensional affine space over $\bC$; $\bA^1_{\bC}$ given by $\Spec$ of $R = \Spec \bC[t]$. The origin of this space corresponds to the maximal ideal generated by $(t)$. If we adjoin $t^{-1}$ to our ring, then the ideal $(t)$ contains $1 = t\cdot t^{-1}$ and is hence no longer prime, but all other prime ideals remain. Thus $\bA^1_{\bC} \setminus \{0\} = \Spec \bC[t,t^{-1}]$, and hence punctured affine space over $\bC$ is in fact also an affine space.

> **Note:** Despite the fact that $\bA^1_{\bC}$ is strictly larger than $\bC$, it is common to interchange $\bA^1_\bC$ and $\bC$ via the identification $\Maxspec(\bC[t]) = \bC$. This is not an egregious abuse of notation when working over an algebraically closed field; one loses nothing by working with $\Maxspec$ instead of $\Spec$ in this setting. We also denote by $\bC^\times$ the space $\bA^1_{\bC} \setminus \{0\}$.

More generally, we see that $(\bC^\times)^n = \Spec \bC[x_1^{\pm},...,x_n^{\pm}]$. Because the punctured complex plane $\bC^\times$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^1$, we call $(\bC^\times)^n$  **the complex $n$-torus and denote it by $\bT^n$**. This is the *torus* in *toric geometry*.
