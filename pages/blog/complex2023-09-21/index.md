# Complex Geometry Lecture 2023-09-21

\toc

We start with two exercises from Huybrechts which Bernd suggested on Tuesday, 2023-09-19.


\thmtitle{Exercise 2.2.7.}{(Isomorphism of line bundles is determined outside of codimension 2)} Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be two holomorphic line bundles on a complex manifold $X$. Suppose that $Y\subset X$ is a submanifold of codimension at least two such that $L_1$ and $L_2$ are isomorphic on $X\setminus Y$. Prove that $L_1 \cong L_2$.
