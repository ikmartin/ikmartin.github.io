<hr />
<p>The new year is upon us, and though I am not a fan of traditional resolutions, I do believe there is utility in writing down one&#39;s goals in an accessible place and returning frequently to analyze progress.</p>
<h2 id="primary_goals"><a href="#primary_goals" class="header-anchor">Primary Goals</a></h2>
<p>If I don&#39;t finish these things, I&#39;ll be quite sad by the time arrives. Here&#39;s the list:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Complete at least 1/3 of the exercises in Chapters II and III of Hartshorne.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Complete the preliminary exam and course requirements for the Ph.D.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Work through most of Fulton&#39;s <em>Introduction to Toric Varieties</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Understand the log geometry portion of &quot;Decomposition of degenerate Gromov-Witten invariants&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose an advisor</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="complete_at_least_13_of_the_exercises_in_chapters_ii_and_iii_of_hartshorne"><a href="#complete_at_least_13_of_the_exercises_in_chapters_ii_and_iii_of_hartshorne" class="header-anchor">Complete at least 1/3 of the exercises in Chapters II and III of Hartshorne.</a></h4>
<p>I&#39;ve been working through Hartshorne sporadically over the past two years. It&#39;s time to wade through it earnestly. There are a total of <strong>222 exercises</strong> between chapters II and III of Hartshorne, so I&#39;ll need to complete <strong>74 exercises</strong> by May. That&#39;s about <strong>2 exercises every 3 days</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="complete_the_preliminary_exam_and_course_requirements_for_the_phd"><a href="#complete_the_preliminary_exam_and_course_requirements_for_the_phd" class="header-anchor">Complete the preliminary exam and course requirements for the Ph.D.</a></h4>
<p>UT Austin&#39;s math Ph.D. program requires students to complete 7 preliminary courses in order to advance to the second stage of the Ph.D., and at least 3 of those courses by exam. I&#39;ve finished one exam and two courses at the time of this writing. I think I&#39;ll receive credit for 3 courses I completed at Utah and will take two more exams in January. If everything goes perfectly then I will be done quite soon, but in the likely scenario in which I fail at least one of the exams, I will need to study and retake it in either June or August. If I am done with this stage of the Ph.D. by Fall 2023, I&#39;ll consider that a success.</p>
<h4 id="work_through_most_of_fultons_introduction_to_toric_varieties"><a href="#work_through_most_of_fultons_introduction_to_toric_varieties" class="header-anchor">Work through most of Fulton&#39;s <em>Introduction to Toric Varieties</em></a></h4>
<p>I&#39;m going to help run the Beginner Algebraic Geometry Seminar &#40;BAGS&#41; during the Spring of 2023 &#40;see the <a href="/pages/blog/toric-page">seminar webpage</a>&#41;. Our primary goal is to work through the majority of Fulton&#39;s toric varieties textbook.</p>
<h4 id="understand_the_log_geometry_portion_of_decomposition_of_degenerate_gromov-witten_invariants"><a href="#understand_the_log_geometry_portion_of_decomposition_of_degenerate_gromov-witten_invariants" class="header-anchor">Understand the log geometry portion of &quot;Decomposition of degenerate Gromov-Witten invariants&quot;</a></h4>
<p>I suspect log geometry will be the topic of my eventual thesis and would like to understand more about it by the end of 2023. The above paper is a bit of a beast, but understanding a piece of it seems reasonable and is a more actionable goal than &quot;understand more log geometry&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="choose_an_advisor"><a href="#choose_an_advisor" class="header-anchor">Choose an advisor</a></h4>
<p>This one is self explanatory.</p>
<h2 id="secondary_goals"><a href="#secondary_goals" class="header-anchor">Secondary Goals</a></h2>
<p>These would be nice things to do, but are either not vital for my advancement towards a Ph.D. or can be completed in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Complete publishable work on Ising computation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Become more familiar with two of the following programming languages: Julia, Rust, Haskell, Go Lang.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Find a preliminary research topic</p>
</li>
<li><p>Complete a machine learning project</p>
</li>
</ul>
