<p>Today I finally understood what Bernd would like me to prove, so I thought I&#39;d write it down here. </p>
<p>First we must understand the localization statement for a scheme \(X\) equipped with the action of a torus \(T\). Denote by \(\hat T = \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathsf{Grp}}(T,\mathbb C^\times)\) the character group of \(T\) and \(S = \operatorname{Sym}(\hat T)\) the symmetric algebra over \(\math Z\) of \(\hat T\) as an Abelian group. The equivariant Chow group of a point identifies to \(S\), and more generally, \(A_*^T(X)\) is a \(S\)-module. The statement of localization for \(X\) then says that the inclusion map \(i:X^T\to X\) of the fixed points into \(X\) induces an isomorphism</p>
\[
    i_*:A^T_*(X^T) \to A^T_*(X)
\]
<p>after inverting all nonzero elements of \(S\). See Corollary 2 of &#91;&quot;Equivariant Chow Groups For Torus Actions&quot;, M. Brion&#93; for this statement and any of the Edin Graham papers for the definitions of equivariant Chow groups.</p>
<p>This statement makes no assumptions on \(X\); in particular, we don&#39;t require \(X\) to be nonsingular. If we <em>do</em> have nonsingularity however we can say more. In this case we have a ring structure on \(A^*_T(X)\), the equivariant Chow ring, given by intersection product. It&#39;s more or less the collection of the following facts &#91;Corollary 3.2.1, &quot;Equivariant Chow Groups For Torus Actions, M. Brion&#93;.</p>
<div class="revindentblock"><p><em>Localization.</em> &nbsp; Let \(X\) be a nonsingular filtrable \(T\)-variety, i.e. a nonsingular variety with a \(T\)-action which is &quot;filterable&quot;. Then</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The inclusion map \(i:X^T\to X\) induces an injective \(S\)-algebra homomorphism \(i^*:A^*_T(X)_{\mathbb Q} \to A^*_T(X^T)_{\mathbb Q}\) which is surjective over the quotient field of \(S\).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The \(S_{\mathbb Q}\)-module \(A_*^T(X)_{\mathbb Q}\) is free. If moreover the \(\mathbb Z\)-module \(A_*(X^T)\) is free, then the \(S\)-module \(A_*^T(X)\) is free.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If \(X^T\) consists of finitely many points \(x_1,...,x_m\), then, for any generic one-paramter subgroup \(\lambda\), the \(S\)-module \(A_*^T(X)\) is freely generated by the classes of the closures of strata \(X_+(x_i,\lambda)\) for \(1\leq i \leq m\).</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<p>There&#39;s stuff I&#39;m not defining here – &quot;filterable&quot; and &quot;\(X_+(x_i, \lambda)\)&quot; for instance – but the important takeaways are that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>there is always a localization isomorphism for a variety \(X\) with a toric action \(T\)</p>
</li>
<li><p>there is a nice localization <em>formula</em> when \(X\) is nonsingular.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The current project is to investigate the existence of a localization *formula</em> in the case of toric singularities. Here are some questions/comments that resulted from today:*</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Which toric varieties are complete intersections? Edin Graham have a localization formula in the case that \(X\hookright M = \mathbb P^N\) is a complete intersection. <em>This question is likely going to be gross – &quot;toric&quot; and &quot;complete intersection&quot; don&#39;t seem to have much to do with one another.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Starting from scratch, understand the localization theorem in the Edin Graham paper and in the M. Brion paper. Look at the toric variety corresponding to the cone over a square &#40;this is not simplicial, simplicial toric varieties have extra stuff you can say about them&#41;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try to start thinking of examples, beginning with a singular surface perhaps, and then computing a localization formula for it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Read some of the examples in section 1.6 of &#91;<em>Convex Bodies in Algebraic Geometry</em>, Oda&#93;. Need to review stuff about toric singularities and refinements of cones etc.</p>
</li>
