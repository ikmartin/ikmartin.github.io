### Phytoestrogen in soy affects male sexuality

It seems to me unlikely that soy affects male sexuality. High [isoflavone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoflavone) intake has been linked to lower sperm counts in animals, in particular those with ruminant digestive tracts, but it is unclear whether this same correlation exists in humans.

**Soy has no affect on male sexuality:**
- [Neither soy nor isoflavone intake affects male reproductive hormones: An expanded and updated meta-analysis of clinical studies (2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33383165/) is a survey article which argues that there is no correlation between soy intake and testosterone levels in men. It analyzes data from peer-reviewed studies in PubMed and CAB databases published between 2010 and 2020. Note that concern over soy is primarily due to the fact it contains [phytoestrogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoestrogen#Effects_on_humans), themselves a type of isofalvone.
- [Dietary patterns, foods and nutrients in male fertility parameters and fecundability: a systematic review of observational studies (2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28333357/) is a survey article which analyzes 35 articles from an identified pool of 1944 articles in an attempt to identify correlations between diet and sperm count in males. 

**Soy negatively affect male sexuality:**
- [Soy food and isoflavone intake in relation to semen quality parameters among men from an infertility clinic](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18650557/) is a study of 99 men in an infertility clinic which found a correlation between soy intake and reduced sperm count. Its findings seem suspect, however, since it studies only men who are part of a couple dealing with infertility issues and has a low sample size. The study did not find any relation between soy intake and sperm motility, sperm morphology or ejaculate volume.
