# Isaac Martin's Homepage

Hello! Putting down personal info and copying relevant portions of my CV is tedious -- I'll get to that in due time. Right now I'm mostly using this site to host random pages contained in [blog](/pages/blog/blog/). 

I'll update the other stuff once a reason presents itself.

This site was built with the Julia package [Franklin](https://franklinjl.org/), and I'm still learning about everything it has to offer. I highly recommend it.
