# Isaac Martin's Homepage

I'm Isaac Martin and this is my website.

Biography: University of Utah (Bachelor's) -> University of Cambridge (Master's) -> University of Texas at Austin (Ph.D. -- working on it).

Here's an outdated copy of my CV: ([CV - Last updated August 2022](/files/CV.pdf)).

This site was built with help from the Julia package [Franklin](https://franklinjl.org/) and styled using a modified version of the formatting found on [Ploum](https://ploum.net).


This site was styled using a modified version of the formatting found on [Ploum](https://ploum.net) and the Julia package [Franklin](https://franklinjl.org/) lets me write in Markdown and LaTeX without *too* much faffing about.
