I'm Isaac, a Ph.D. student at UT Austin studying mirror symmetry. When geometry becomes overwhelming, I also like to think about magnets and how they might be used to build computers which only give you the correct answer sometimes. 

**Biography:** University of Utah (Bachelor's) -> University of Cambridge (Master's) -> University of Texas at Austin (Ph.D. -- working on it).

**Outdated CV:** ([CV - Last updated August 2022](/files/CV.pdf)).

**More words:** I'm passionate about trying to become passionate about running, I could become passionate about trad climbing/canyoneering/backpacking if Austin had more crags/canyons/public land and I'm actually passionate about [Nairn's biscuits](https://nairns.com/wellbeing/gluten-free) and [Strong Towns](https://www.strongtowns.org/about). Consistent access to gluten-free biscuits and walkable streets is, if not a necessary condition for high life satisfaction, at least a sufficient one.

This site was styled using a modified version of the formatting found on [Ploum](https://ploum.net) and the Julia package [Franklin](https://franklinjl.org/) lets me write in Markdown and LaTeX without *too* much faffing about.
