# Software I wrote

## Offpunk

Iâ€™m currently mostly working on Offpunk, a command-line browser for the web, Gemini and Gopher. It works offline and also serves as my RSS reader

## Ploum.net

I wrote a python static generator for this website. It takes Gemini files and translate them into HTML.

## Older projects

I co-created Getting Things GNOME! in 2009 and maintained it until 2014. GTG is still actively developped by others. I also created the liblarch python library.
