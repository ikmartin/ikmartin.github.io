There will be plenty of interesting conferences such as Â« Python and MIDI Â» by Patricio and Â« Secure Login and One-time Password Â» by Thomas, which should work hopefully better than last saturday ðŸ˜‰

At 13:00, I will give a conference in el Centro Universitario de Ciencias EconÃ³mico Administrativas (CERI)[1] , PerifÃ©rico Norte 799, NÃºcleo Universitario Los Belenes, Zapopan, Jalisco. This conference, who will be a delicious mix of English with my fresh (and bad) Spanish, is intended for beginners : it will explain what a software is, what is the Â« source Â», what is Â« Free Software Â» and, of course, explain you why you want to try Ubuntu on your computer.

If you are in Guadalajara this Saturday, just come and take your friends with you. Itâ€™s a good opportunity for non-techies to discover what free softwares are. See the complete schedule. After conferences, I think we will eat and spend the afternoon at LinuxCabal[2].
