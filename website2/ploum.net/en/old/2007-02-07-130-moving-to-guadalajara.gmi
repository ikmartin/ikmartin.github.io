# Moving to Guadalajaraâ€¦

As from the 14th of March, I will quit Waterloo and move to a bigger city called Guadalajara. I will stay there for at least 3 months and, who knows, maybe more if I like living in Mexico and I can find a job there. Do I forget to mention it ? Guadalajara is indeed in Mexico.

Guadalajara is between Mexico city and the Pacific Ocean

Thereâ€™s a couple of things I will need so, dear lazyweb, if you can help me to find them, any help would be gladly appreciated ðŸ™‚

* A job ! Iâ€™m a computer science engineer so there must be jobs for me in Guadalajara but I donâ€™t speak spanish yet so it might be difficult. A job related to Linux or free softwares would be of course the best (I can always ask ðŸ˜‰ ). Any remote job would be fine too. For people in France or USA, it doesnâ€™t matter if Iâ€™m in Belgium or in Mexico. (I can send you my CV upon request)
* Friends. If you are in the area and want to meet a Belgian Ubuntu geek or if you are part of a local LUG, drop me a mail (I will probably not reply before the 14th of March but, anywayâ€¦)
* A laptop. I need to buy a laptop before my departure. I want one that will run Ubuntu smoothly, that is pretty solid and not to heavy. And I also want one that does not heat too much just under your hand ! Any advice for me ?

I know it sounds silly to ask that on my blog. But anyway, I can always ask. So, if you have any advice to share with me, donâ€™t hesitate to contact me : ploum at ubuntu.com.

And now, the FAQ for friends :

* Why do you want to go there ?

Why not ?

* But why Mexico and Guadalajara ?

Because I have very good friends there. My friend David told me one day : Â« If you want to come in Mexico, I will help you to find a job there ! Â». He was joking. I just replied : Â« We have a deal ! Â»

* But what will you do in Mexico ?

If I knew it, there would be no sense to go there ðŸ™‚

* Do you speak spanish ?

I guess that I learn quickly

* Is there a girl involved in the story ?

Yes, of course. But not in the way you think. She lives in Paris and sheâ€™s a very close friend. I know, it sounds mysterious, it isnâ€™t. Itâ€™s just a friend.

* Do you have a girlfriend in Guadalajara ?

None (yet?). The only girl I know from Guadalajara lives now in Paris. But if all girls in Guadalajara are like her, I feel I will stay more than 3 months ðŸ˜‰

* Will you ever come back in Belgium ? Or is this only some hollydays ?

I donâ€™t know. How can I ? I donâ€™t consider this as an hollyday at all. I want to try to live there. But living in Mexico and in Belgium seems to be somewhat a different experience. Will I like it ? Will I adapt to it ? Is the Internet connection fast enought ? The only way to know is to try.

* Will we keep contact ?

In Mexico, the only way to communicate is by using engraved stones sent over carrier pigeon. So it might be difficult. (Yes, it is a dumb question !) As I have a blog, I will not send mails to 100 people to keep them informed about how sick I am after eating mexican food. If you want to receive such news in your mailbox, just subscribe to the list.

* Will I see you before you take off ?

I hope so ! Why not doing something huge for my birthday ? (9th of March, as a reminder ðŸ˜‰ )

* Can I come to see you in Mexico ?

Well, at first I will live in my friends house. But as soon as I live alone, you are of course welcome !

Itâ€™s snowing here in Waterloo. Iâ€™m pretty sure that the Sun is shinning in Guadalajara. Anyway, life is Ãœber sweet, I like it ðŸ™‚ Rock-n-roll !
