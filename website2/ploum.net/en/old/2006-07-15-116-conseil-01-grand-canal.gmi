# Conseil 0.1 « Grand Canal »

=> ../files/old/conseil/canal.jpg Grand Canal

I’m happy to announce you the release 0.1 « Grand Canal » of Conseil. Conseil is a bug reader (and soon triager) for the GNOME desktop. Currently, Launchpad is the only supported bug tracking system.

With release 0.1, you can start to use Conseil as a bug reader. There is still no way to modify a bug but you can search, bookmark and open bugs in your web browser. It’s not that useful, bug displaying is ugly but, at least, bookmarks are stored in a nice XML file. Awesome, isn’t it ?

Sadly, modifying bugs on Launchpad by screenscraping is incredibly complex and 0.2 will be a lot of pain. Any tips about mechanize is more than welcome.

If you have a problem with Conseil 0.1, report a bug and describe precisely how to reproduce it. You can of course also report feature requests or ideas.
